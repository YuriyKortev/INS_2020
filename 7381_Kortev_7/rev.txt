This is probably one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen!
From the relationship of the two characters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking!
tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romance never to be forgotten.
You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story.
it is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable!
I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again.
It feels like you are reading a diary watching this film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is.
Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet,
be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day!
