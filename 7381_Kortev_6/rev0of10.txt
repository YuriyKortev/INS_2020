To reiterate: What the actual fuck? I literally cannot understand why this is nominated for Oscars and not for Golden Raspberries. 
I'm not even going to say anything about the peach scene. If you want to have the urge to gouge your eyes out, just google it. 
But I warn you, if you don't want lasting psychological trauma, please take my advice and never watch this movie. 
This isn't about whether I support gays or not. This is about the fact that the main character put his head into another guy's underwear (without his consent or knowledge)
and humped the air. 
You know what? I'll tell you about the peach scene. 
The peach scene is the scene in which the main character makes a hole in a peach and.... into it.
Later the other guy tries to eat the peach, but thankfully the MC stops him. Please, I'm doing this for your own good, just DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.
