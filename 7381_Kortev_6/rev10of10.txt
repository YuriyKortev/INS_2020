I have seen the movie several times now and every time I watch it I see something new, something I haven't seen or heard before. Some unsung line, some lost message...
 Every time I watch the movie I seem to dig deeper into this complex work of art.
However, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that this movie is so underestimated, and, above all, misunderstood.
 How many times have you heard someone say something like: "You can't watch  unless you're really drunk or really high" ? 
I have heard this line probably from every single person that has seen the movie and it hurts me so much that nobody really tries to understand the movie.
The key to understanding the movie is in the lyrics. The movie is not just a long series of video clips that accompany the album.
 The images are just a final piece of the puzzle, the final touch on a magnificent piece of art.
The first time I saw this movie I felt very embarassed. 
Yes, embarassed, because I felt like a fool for hearing the album so many times and not realizing what it was about. 
The movie made me appreciate the lyrics of a rock song for the first time in my life.
The week after seeing for the first time I bought. Do you know what was the first thing I did when I opened the CD case? 
I read the lyrics, from the first to the last word. And I actually tried to understand what the was about.
is so much more than you think it is. The only solution to not understaning the movie is watching it again and paying more attention. 
Once you get it, you will never forget it.
